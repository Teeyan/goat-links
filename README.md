# GOAT-Links
Chrome extension for personal go links, no need for subscriptions or enterprise stuff like Trotti. These links are for a personalized use case and not tied to any physical server. They'll automatically propagate to all your chrome browsers on all your machines!

## What's a go link?
Go links are a nifty little url shortener akin to programatic bookmarks. For example instead of navigating to a google doc with a long url like "https://www.docs.google.com/documents/thisisalongandnotdescriptivehash" you could just type go/neatdoc in your browser and get linked right over.

## How does it work?
It's really simple! Click on the chrome extension on the top right of your browser. You'll be able to view your existing go links and add new ones. Just type in a go-value to associate with and a go-link and hit create and the next time you navigate to go-<value> you'll be redirected to your specified go-link.

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repository and open up chrome browser. Navigate to your extensions dashboard (chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode (the toggle in the top right).

You'll see a top bar menu drop down. Hit load unpacked and load the src/ folder from this repo. You should see the extension pop up in your dashboard and ini your navbar. After that you're good to go!
